Implement Concrete Repositories:

Create actual implementations of the UserRepository and AuthRepository interfaces
Initially, these can still use in-memory storage but follow the interface contracts

Implement Service Layer:

Create implementations of the UserService and AuthService interfaces
These services will use the repository interfaces to perform operations

Refactor Handlers:

Update the HTTP handlers to use the service interfaces instead of direct implementation

Dependency Injection:

Set up proper dependency injection to wire everything together
